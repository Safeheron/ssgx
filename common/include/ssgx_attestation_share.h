/**

 * These result codes are declared in:
 * https://github.com/intel/SGXDataCenterAttestationPrimitives/blob/main/QuoteVerification/QvE/Include/sgx_qve_header.h
 *
 * SGX QVL results are defined in the range 0x0000 ~ 0x00FF:
 *  - e.g., Ok (0x0000), ConfigNeeded (0x0001), etc.
 *
 * This clear separation helps to distinguish errors originating from SGX verification
 * versus errors caused by internal library processing.
